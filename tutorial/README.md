## How to run the Tests

First run the command *cmake -S . -B build*,

then build it with cmake with *cmake --build build*,

finally change to build directory and start ctest

```
my_project$ cmake -S . -B build
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 10.2.1
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 10.2.1
...
-- Build files have been written to: .../my_project/build

my_project$ cmake --build build
Scanning dependencies of target gtest

my_project$ cd build && ctest
